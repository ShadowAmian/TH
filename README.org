* What is TH?
In a word, this is a libTH binding (in fact, libATen, which has libTH) for Common Lisp. After working on the journey of MTX, I found
that writing a binding is better than starting from BLAS/LAPACK. And I cannot find an existing binding library for Common Lisp, I
wrote one for myself.
Another feature I'd like to have is some kind of automatic backpropagation, so I'm working on it during reading the book
"Deep Learning from Scratch" again.

* How to Use
** You have to build libATen from pytorch - You may have to install another libraries for building libATen.
** Clone this repository and setup local project for quicklisp.
** You can quick load th.

* Examples
** examples/tensor.lisp - tensor related, mostly from torch
** examples/ad.lisp - my humble auto gradient/auto backpropagation, copiled from clj-autograd of whilo
** dlfs - my following up of the book "Deep Learning from Scratch"
